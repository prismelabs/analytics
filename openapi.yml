  title: Prisme Analytics REST API
  description: |-
    This is the REST API for [Prisme Analytics](https://www.prismeanalytics.com).

    **Notes:**
    - HTTP 5XX errors are not listed for each endpoint.
      These should be handled globally. Not all HTTP 5XX errors are generated from Prisme, and they may serve non-JSON content. Make sure you inspect the `Content-Type` header before parsing as JSON.
    - Error responses are somewhat inconsistent.
      Avoid using the `msg` and HTTP status code to identify errors. HTTP 400 and 422 are used interchangeably in many APIs.
    - Rate limit errors are consistently raised with the HTTP 429 code.

    **Backward compatibility:**
    - Endpoints marked as _Experimental_ may change without notice.
    - Endpoints marked as _Deprecated_ will be supported for at least 3 months since being marked as deprecated.
    - HTTP status codes like 400, 404, 422 may change for the same underlying error condition.
